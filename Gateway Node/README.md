# Gateway Node

This folder will contains all the codes and documentation for the environmental sensor nodes.

## Hardware

The board used is the STM32MP1 which is capable of doing deep learning and machine learning calcultion.

On top of that we will had a ST LRWAN Gateway expansion Board to receive the data from the sensors nodes.


We want to thank ST Microelectronic for providing the boards.
