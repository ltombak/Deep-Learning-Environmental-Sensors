# Sensor Nodes

This folder will contains all the codes and documentation for the environmental sensor nodes.

## Hardware

The boards used are the Nucleo STM32 LoRa Discovery kit (B-L072Z-LRWAN1). These were selected for their low-power capabilities and LoRaWAN connectivity.

On top of that we will had a BME280 sensor (Temp, Humidity and Pressure) and some others sensors.


We want to thank ST Microelectronic for providing the boards.
